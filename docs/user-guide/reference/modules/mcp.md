# MCP module

## What it does

MCP presents the host's same-user companion readiness and the selected classic
Mac's explicit ceiling on what an agent may observe or change.

## Availability

The host owns the companion and projections. PowerPC provides the machine
consent page. NOW-68K does not expose this MCP consent surface.

## On the modern Mac

The host shows companion transport, catalog, selected machine, available
capabilities, grant state, and auditable calls. A live socket is not a grant.

## On the classic Mac

The PowerPC MCP page sets the machine's ceiling. It cannot supply host-local
credentials or prove that a companion can reach the host.

## Common tasks

- Confirm the selected machine and requested capability before granting.
- Read the recent call record after an agent action.

## Safety, consent, and privacy

Global companion connection, host authentication, and per-machine grants are
separate controls. Do not weaken same-user socket or local endpoint limits to
connect a client.

## Failure states

Companion unavailable, not addressed, not granted, capability unavailable,
stale reference, local authentication failure, and machine refusal are typed.

## Current limitations

The 68K guest has no matching consent UI. Experimental semantic tools inherit
Mirror's narrower observation and act evidence.

## For developers

See [agent boundary](../../../developer-guide/architecture/agent-boundary.md)
and [MCP coverage](../../../mcp-coverage.md).
