# Build and test

## Run the full gate

```sh
scripts/test-all
```

The script runs cheap contract/native checks before package, documentation, cross-compile, and Xcode work. It stops on the first failing stage and names it. Do not replace it with `swift test`: the app target and the guest cross-compilers are separate failure surfaces.

## Run a focused stage

```sh
scripts/test-native frame
scripts/test-mirrorkit
scripts/test-docs
scripts/build-guests
scripts/test-host
```

Guest builds may skip when Retro68 is unavailable. State the skip. Metal suites are opt-in through their documented environment variables and fail, rather than skip, once opted in.

## Verify a new guard

Mutate the exact condition the guard claims to detect, prove the mutation built, and observe that test fail. Restore the source and observe it pass. A build failure is not a test failure, and a different mutation is not evidence for the named guard.
